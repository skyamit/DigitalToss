# DigitalToss

This is a toss application, in which we can toss and let the application decide It is head or tails.

We can see Head and Tails images of coins and A message will be displayed as well.

How works:

1. If Flip the coin button is clicked then:
2. we generate random number.
3. Then we divide it by 2 and store remainder in different variable.
4. If remainder is 0 then we display Tail image and message "Tail won the Toss"
5. If remainder is 1 then we display Head image and message "Head won the Toss"
